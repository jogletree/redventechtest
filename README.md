Red Ventures Technical Test 
## How to Execute my Code
Create a folder and name it anything and include the 2 package filed and conf file.  Create a subfolder called test and includue the test1 file.  Install selenium stand a lone and make sure a version of node is installed.  In command prompt - open the folder you created and use npm test to run the test1 file.

## My Approach
I used the installing and execution instructions directly off the WebDriverIO page. 
I installed config file so wouldn't have to use the node call each time I needed to run my call. 
This approach also allowed me to use Mocha.
