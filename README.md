Red Ventures Technical Test 
## How to Execute my Code
Save config file under a folder and the test1.jas file under a subfolder called test.
In command prompt use npm test to run application.

## My Approach
I used the installing and execution instructions directly off the WebDriverIO page. 
I installed config file so wouldn't have to use the node call each time I needed to run my call. 
This approach also allowed me to use Mocha.
